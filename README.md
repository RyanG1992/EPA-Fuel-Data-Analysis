# EPA-Fuel-Data-Analysis
This project explores how vehicle types, manufacturers, and technical specifications drive fuel economy and annual fuel costs. The data set contains over 38,000 unique vehicles with manufactured years ranging from 1984 to 2017.

Combined fuel economy is expressed as combined miles per gallon (combined MPG), which is the average measure of how many miles a vehicle travels on one gallon of its primary fuel type (FT1) assuming 55% is city driving and 45% is highway driving. Annual fuel cost is based on 15,000 miles, 55% city driving and 45% highway driving, and the price of fuel used by the vehicle (we explore Fuel Type 1, also known as FT1).
